Technical Architecture & Design: Data Science Playground
1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed technical overview of the Data Science Playground application. While the README.md focuses on user-facing features and setup, this document delves into the architectural decisions, component design, data flow, and implementation details. It is intended for developers, contributors, and those curious about the application's internal workings.

2. Core Design Philosophy
The application was built on several key principles:
 * Modularity and Separation of Concerns: Although contained within a single app.py script for simplicity, there is a strong logical separation between the UI rendering (Streamlit calls) and the backend data processing logic (compute_eda, train_model, train_clustering). This separation was critical for enabling isolated unit testing and maintaining code clarity.

 * Statelessness and Efficient Computation: Streamlit's execution model re-runs the script on every user interaction. To manage this, I employed two core strategies:
   * st.session_state: Used to persist state across re-runs, such as the uploaded DataFrame and user selections. This prevents data from being lost on every button click.
   * @st.cache_data: This decorator is used on all expensive functions (compute_eda, train_model). It acts as a memoization layer, caching the return values of a function. If the function is called again with the exact same input parameters, Streamlit returns the cached result instantly instead of re-executing the function, leading to a massive performance boost.

 * Robustness and Graceful Failure: The backend functions are designed to be resilient to problematic inputs. This includes explicitly handling edge cases like:
   * Empty or malformed CSV files.
   * Datasets with insufficient data for model training or cross-validation.
   * Algorithm-specific constraints (e.g., ensuring t-SNE's perplexity is valid for the given sample size).

 * AI as a Usability Enhancer: The integration of the Google Gemini API was designed to serve two practical purposes:
   * Guidance: Lowering the barrier to entry by providing an initial recommendation for a model and features.
   * Interpretation: Translating complex quantitative results (like MSE or Inertia) into qualitative, easy-to-understand explanations for non-experts.

3. Component Deep Dive
3.1. The train_model Unified Pipeline
This function is the most complex component and the heart of the supervised learning feature. Its final design is a unified pipeline architecture, which is the industry-standard best practice for scikit-learn.

Why a Pipeline?
The primary motivation is to prevent data leakage. When performing operations like data scaling (StandardScaler) and cross-validation, it is critical that the parameters for the scaler are learned only from the training data for each fold. A Pipeline encapsulates these steps, and scikit-learn's cross_val_score function correctly handles this encapsulation, ensuring that each fold is processed independently and correctly.

Pipeline Structure:
The final_model object within the function is constructed dynamically based on user selections:
 * StandardScaler (Always present): The first step is always to scale the features.
 * PolynomialFeatures (Optional): If feature_eng=True, this step is added to the pipeline to create interaction terms and polynomial features (x^2, x_1x_2, etc.).
 * The Estimator (The Model): The final step is the machine learning model itself (e.g., LogisticRegression, RandomForestRegressor).
Handling Tuning (GridSearchCV):
If tuning=True, the entire Pipeline object is wrapped within a GridSearchCV object.

This is a powerful pattern. The param_grid's keys are prefixed with the pipeline step name (e.g., model__n_estimators) to tell GridSearchCV which step's hyperparameters to tune. This ensures that for every combination of hyperparameters, the entire pipeline is re-run, maintaining the integrity of the validation process.

3.2. AI Integration and Prompt Engineering
The application uses two distinct, structured prompts to interact with the Google Gemini API. Using structured JSON for both input and output ensures reliability and avoids parsing fragile, free-form text.
 * RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE:
   * Goal: To act as an expert data scientist suggesting a starting point.
   * Input: Dataset headers and a few rows of sample data.
   * Task: The prompt constrains the LLM to choose a model from a predefined list and identify the most logical feature (X) and target (Y) columns. It must return a valid JSON object.
   * Output: A JSON object with recommended_x, recommended_y, recommended_model, and a brief explanation.

 * INTERPRETATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE:
   * Goal: To act as a friendly explainer for a non-technical user.
   * Input: The model type, feature names, and the final performance metric (e.g., MSE, Accuracy).
   * Task: The prompt instructs the LLM to explain the result in simple terms, tailoring the explanation to the specific metric provided.
   * Output: A JSON object containing a single interpretation string.

3.3. Unsupervised Learning (train_clustering)
The clustering function also handles important technical details:
 * Dimensionality Reduction: It offers both PCA (a fast, linear method) and t-SNE (a slower, non-linear method for visualizing high-dimensional data).
 * Dynamic perplexity for t-SNE: The t-SNE algorithm has a perplexity hyperparameter that must be less than the number of samples. The code dynamically calculates a valid value (min(30, n_samples - 1)) to prevent the algorithm from crashing on small datasets, a common pitfall.

3.4. Testing Strategy (test_app.py)
The unit testing suite is designed to validate the robustness of the backend logic.
 * Focus: The tests target the data processing functions, not the Streamlit UI components.
 * Test Cases: The suite covers:
   * Happy Path: Basic, valid inputs.
   * Edge Cases: Empty DataFrames (test_compute_eda_empty), and datasets too small to be processed (test_train_model_insufficient_data).
   * Parameterization: Tests for functionalities triggered by flags like tuning=True and feature_eng=True.

 * Test Design: The final state of the tests revealed the importance of robust test design. An initial failure on test_train_model_logistic_regression was ultimately traced not to a bug in the code, but to a "brittle" test that combined a tiny test set with a difficult data split and a loose solver tolerance. The fix was to adjust the test to represent a more reasonable scenario, a key lesson in testing ML systems.

4. Data Flow and State Management
The application follows a clear data flow orchestrated by Streamlit:
 * Upload: User uploads a CSV. The file is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
 * State Persistence: The DataFrame df is immediately stored in st.session_state['df']. This is the single source of truth for the dataset.
 * UI Interaction: All widgets (e.g., st.selectbox for choosing columns) read their default values from st.session_state and, upon interaction, update the state.
 * Backend Call: When the "Train Model" button is clicked, the train_model function is called with parameters pulled from the current st.session_state.
 * Caching: Before execution, @st.cache_data checks if train_model has been called with this exact set of parameters before. If so, it returns the cached result.
 * Execution: If not cached, the function runs, performing the split, pipeline fitting, and cross-validation.
 * Return & Display: The results (model object, metrics, predictions) are returned. The UI code then uses these results to display metrics and Plotly charts.
 * Loop: The script finishes, and Streamlit waits for the next user interaction, preserving the entire application state in st.session_state.
